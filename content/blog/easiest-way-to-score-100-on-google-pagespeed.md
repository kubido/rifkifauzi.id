![100% score!](https://res.cloudinary.com/dy7pjvtw2/image/upload/bo_3px_solid_rgb:909090/v1558923264/rifkifauzi_id/Screen_Shot_2019-05-27_at_05.13.32.png)

## How to?
the trick is easy, but it might be very hard for some of you who already have existed website or blog.  

1. Use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (it's static site generator)
2. and use my customized Hugo theme [here](https://github.com/kubido/cocoa-hugo-theme)


## how could this be possible?
by default the [cocoa theme](https://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme) is score around 90. the problem with the default theme it's  not optimized when displaying font. 
since there's no `font-display` property in their CSS file. so what I do is adding that `font-display` property to the CSS file 


### disclaimer
the 100 score is for website, as for mobile since I added `facebook` and `google-tag-manager` script. it's downgraded to 86.
